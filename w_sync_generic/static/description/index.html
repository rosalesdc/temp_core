            <p>This gives us the possibility of having the
                desired information replicated in two different systems,
                achieving high integrity. This synchronization consists of
                sending or receiving the records that were created, modified or
                deleted in one of the two systems, be it Odoo or the external system,
                and need to be replicated in the other. This process can be carried
                out in two modes, by Planned Action (Via Cron) or in Real Time. The
                Via Cron mode performs the synchronization at a specific date and
                time, allowing us to establish the frequency with which we want it
                to be executed. This mode has the advantage that the user does not
                intervene at any time in the process, which is activated and executed
                automatically. The Real Time mode is activated when the user makes
                a creation, modification or deletion of a record whose table is
                defined in the configuration that requires synchronization.
                It has the advantage that both systems are up-to-date at all times.</p>

                <li><b>Synchronization Mode:</b> We define if this model will be synchronized
                    by Via Cron or in Real time. It is important to clarify that when
                    Real Time is selected, Odoo can only be selected as External address,
                    because the Real Time synchronization for the records from the

                            synchronization mode is Via Cron. It is defined to establish the
                            priority in case there is a record that has been modified both in
                            Odoo and in the External System, to define which modification prevails.
                        </li>

                <li><b>Odoo Ref field:</b> It is the reference field in Odoo, it will always
                 be the external Id field.</li>
                <li><b>Model removed:</b> This field is only visible when the sync mode is
                    Via Cron. It must be established if we want the registers deleted
                    in Odoo to also be deleted in the External System.
                    When establishing it, a single option is listed, that is the
                    one we must select.</li>
                 <li><b>External Model:</b> We select the External Model homologous to contacts.
                     We have already configured this in the Synchronization Models section.</li>
                 <li><b>External Ref. Field:</b> It is the reference field in the External System,
                it is among the fields that we define in the Synchronization Model
                for this model. It must be the Id of the record in the External System.</li>
                <li><b>Domain and Limit:</b> This is used if we define a domain of the records
                in Odoo that we want to synchronize. For example. In Odoo,
                in the res.partner model, there are all the contacts, clients,
                companies, etc. If we only wanted to synchronize customers it
                would be [('customer', '=', True)]. The limit is used to define the
                number of records in each synchronization if it is Via Cron mode.</li>
                 <li><b>Odoo field:</b> Corresponds to the fields in Odoo that we want to
                synchronize and match with its counterpart. The External ID field
                should never be missing.</li>
                <li><b>External Field:</b> Corresponds to the fields in the External System.
                They are already defined in the Synchronization Model, it only remains
                to pair them.</li>
                <li><b>Reference Field: </b> This is very important, it should only be established
                if the field that we want to synchronize is relational, that is, it
                is One2many, Many2many or Many2one. It is the field by which the
                records are related.</li>
