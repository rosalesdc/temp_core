                    <b>NOTE:</b> Reversal entries are those made to reverse a previous entry. In a reversal entry, however,
                    the accounts and the amounts assigned to them must be used, only the accounts that were 
                    previously placed as debits must now be placed as credits, and vice versa.

                    You post a customer invoice, it is signed by the SAT, for any reason you decide to cancel it, as the invoice 
                    has been signed by the SAT, you have to request the cancellation of the document, using the Request EDI Cancellation button.

                    Once the invoice is cancelled by SAT, a reversal entry is automatically created, in order to keep 
                    the accounting balanced in the period. 
                    The invoice is marked as reversed because the reversing entry is reconciled with the invoice.

                    will be related to the substitution invoice using the code 04|fiscal folio, in the field CFDI Origin.
                    If the current invoice which will be substitued by the new one, has to be the fiscal folio and signed by SAT, otherwise, we will get a raise error at the moment
                    we try to create the substitution invoice, fiscal folio and valid SAT status are required in this case.

                    As you can see, the substitution invoice has the fiscal folio of the source invoice, due to we have to inform to SAT 
                    that this invoice substitutes the source invoice and it will be cancelled.
                    A message is shown, indicating that this invoice is being substitued that invoice, once the current invoice is signed, it will
                    be automatically related to the source invoice in the field Substituted By.

                    As we commented it, the substitution invoice was related to the source invoice in the field Substituted By, a message is shown, indicating
                    that the current invoice has been substituted by that invoice, and it is required to cancel this one, in the cancellation process we used the
                    reason 01, CFDI emitted with errors with relationship.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Now we have to request the cancellation for the invoice, using the button, Request Cancellation.
                    If the invoice is correctly cancelled by SAT, the reversal entry is created and related to it, the invoice
                    is marked as reversed due to the reversal entry. PAC and SAT status are stablished in cancelled.
