        <h3 class="oe_slogan" style="text-align: justify;">This module adds the functionality to relate advances that were previously created from a sales order. There are two approaches to deduct the advances, the first is to relate the advances generated in the final invoice, the second is not to relate them to the final invoice but to create an amendment for the total amount of the advances.</h3>

                    In order to deduct the advances to the final invoice we take the sum of the untaxed amount of all advances 
                    and we obtain the advance percentage to be applied to each invoice line by the next operation: (amount advance / amount untaxed) * 100.
                    This percentage is applied to the price subtotal of each line to get the price unit of the invoice line, 
                    if the line has quantity higher than 1 then we divide the (price unit / quantity) and the result is the price unit for the invoice line.
